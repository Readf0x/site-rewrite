# Personal Statement

I've always been interested in computers,

# Future Plans

I'm on course to graduate from my high school with a distinguished academic & career and technical diploma, along with various college credits. After that I'll take a few years to just live my life, work on myself, and rest. Then I'll go to college and get a bachelor's in computer science. It's possible I might get a more niche degree like software development, but it's unlikely I can get one without first getting a bachelor's degree. Everything after that is an uncertainty, I might get some software dev certificates to help me get a job, but there's not much other than that planned. My end goal is to live in a more socialist country like Norway or The Netherlands, but that's a long ways off from now.

# Hobbies

## Linux

I've recently (as in a year or two ago) gotten into using Linux. I still dualboot a stripped down version of Windows 11 for VR, but other than that I only use Linux on my home PC. My journey with Linux started when my dad started using [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com) on his PC. He really enjoyed using it, and told me all the things he thought made it better than Windows. When my Windows install got borked, I decided to switch to Pop!\_OS as well.

Eventually, I decided to jump in the deep end and just install regular Arch Linux. And it was surprisingly easier than I expected! It took me about a week to get my system set up in a state that I liked, and I still tinker with it constantly even now. Right now I run [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) and things are going great! I have my workflow extremely optimized with a ton of hotkeys, and more get added all the time.

## Keyboards

I don't really remember what got me into custom mechanical keyboards, but I can tell you that I really became interested when I found the [Glarses YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Glarses). Glarses is really more of a comedy YouTuber who's content is keyboard related[^1]. The hobby is really expensive, so I've only built one board, and I would've done it way differently knowing what I do now. My current board is a GMMK[^2] TKL[^3] with [alpaca switches](https://www.primekb.com/products/alpaca-linears) and typewriter keycaps. I could've gotten a way better board for the same price, but I didn't know what I was doing at the time.

[^2]: Glorious Modular Mechanical Keyboard. Yes that is seriously the name of this thing.
[^3]: Short for ten-keyless, it just means the keyboard doesn't have a numpad.

## Gaming

I've been gaming since about age 5, when my mom gave me her old gameboy color along with PokÃ©mon and Tetris. I played those games so much, but I never got very far. I suppose that's just how it goes. A few years after my brother was born my dad gave me his old PC along with Minecraft. I played that game to death. My favorite game of all time is Portal 2, it's a real masterclass in puzzle games. The comedy in that game is golden. I recently played through a game called ULTRAKILL, and it's certainly lives up to it's place as the #9 FPS game on Steam. I've also been enjoying Battlebit, which, despite it's graphics, is one of the best FPS games I've ever played.
