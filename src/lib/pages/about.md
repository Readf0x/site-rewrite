## Linux

I've recently (a year or two ago) gotten into using Linux. I still dualboot a stripped down version of Windows 11 for VR, but other than that I only use Linux on my home PC. My journey with Linux started when with my dad. He started using [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com) on his PC, and when my Windows install got borked, I decided to switch to Pop!\_OS as well.

Pop was a great beginner distro, because it made things very simple for me without completely abstracting everything away. I eventually needed to reinstall because I stopped using an Nvidia GPU, and I wanted to use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). Arch Linux is notoriously hard to use because it's a DIY distro, so I decided to use one of the many forks of Arch, Manjaro.

Big mistake, let me tell you that. Manjaro breaks _a lot_. I couldn't even change the system theme. So I immediately quit using Manjaro after about 2 hours of things breaking and found Artix. Artix is a really cool project, but it's not what I was looking for either.

Since Arch's forks weren't working for me, I decided to jump in the deep end and just install regular Arch Linux. And it was surprisingly easier than I expected! It took me about a week to get my system set up in a state that I liked, and I still tinker with it constantly even now. Right now I run [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) and things are going great! I have my workflow extremely optimized with a ton of hotkeys, and more get added all the time.

## Gaming

I've been gaming since about age 5, when my mom gave me her old gameboy color along with Pok√©mon and Tetris. I played those games so much, but I never got very far. I suppose that's just how it goes. A few years after my brother was born my dad gave me his old PC along with Minecraft. I played that game to death. Every day when my brother was took a nap, around noonish I think, I would get my parents to bring down the computer so I could play. I think it was running Windows 7 or Vista? Doesn't really matter I suppose.
