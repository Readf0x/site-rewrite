# Hi, I'm Davis Forsythe

I'm currently a junior at Horn Lake High School enrolled in dual credit classes with Northwest Community College. I plan to study computer science and become a software dev, but I don't have any specific college in mind. I've always said that if I don't go to an ivy league college, it doesn't really matter where I go.

I've lived in Mississippi my whole life, but I plan to move out of the US eventually. Ideally I'd like to live in a more socialist country like Norway or The Netherlands, but for now I'm still in the good ole' US of A.

I have a variety of hobbies, but most of them are at least computer-adjacent. Some of the hobbies I really enjoy include:

- Linux
- Gaming
- Mechanical keyboards
